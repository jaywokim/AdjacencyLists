# AdjacencyLists

Alignment Viewer is a simple, dependency-free widget to visualize multiple genome sequences.

This repository was created for use by CDC programs to collaborate on public health surveillance related projects in support of the CDC Surveillance Strategy.  Github is not hosted by the CDC, but is used by CDC and its partners to share information and collaborate on software.

## Demo

```{javascript}
sequences = [
  'ACTGACTAGCTAGCTAACTG',
  'GCATCGTAGCTAGCTACGAT',
  'CATCGATCGTACGTACGTAG',
  'ATCGATCGATCGTACGATCG'
];
alignmentViewer(sequences).then(function(canvas){
  document.body.appendChild(canvas);
});
```

See [the Source Code](https://github.com/cdcgov/AlignmentViewer/blob/master/demo/index.html) of [the Demo](https://cdcgov.github.io/AlignmentViewer/demo) for a slightly fleshier [live version](https://cdcgov.github.io/AlignmentViewer/demo).

## Syntax

`alignmentViewer(seqs, config)` where:
* `seqs` - an array of sequence strings
* `config` - OPTIONAL, an object containing any of the following attributes:
* `config.width` - OPTIONAL, the width (in pixels) _of each cell_. Please note that this is not the width of the output figure. Defaults to 10
* `config.height` - OPTIONAL, the height (in pixels) _of each cell_. Please note that this is not the height of the output figure. Defaults to 10
* `config.showChar` - OPTIONAL, should the character be rendered in the cell? Defaults to false
* `config.colors` - OPTIONAL, an object mapping from the nucleotide to the color of the corresponding cell in the output image. Defaults to the [Taylor color scheme](http://www.jalview.org/help/html/colourSchemes/taylor.html):
```
{
  'A' : 'lightgreen',
  'G' : 'orange',
  'C' : 'yellow',
  'T' : 'red',
  'ambig': 'white'
}
```

Fun fact: It's actually alphabet-agnostic, so you can map any character to a color and see it. So you can visualize, say, protein sequences by just setting `config.colors` to an object mapping from the IUPAC 1-letter codes to the desired color.

## Isn't this what [MSAViewer](http://msa.biojs.net/) is for?

Yup.

## So why build another?

MSAViewer is [an awesome App](http://msa.biojs.net/app/). However, it's a difficult widget. What I mean is, it works great on pages where it's the only thing happening. But it has some annoying behaviors. For example, it imports [underscore](http://underscorejs.org). While this is fine and common, [it overwrites `window._`](https://github.com/wilzbach/msa/issues/236), which is a huge annoyance when you're using, say [lodash](https://lodash.com/).

A big cause of this is the simple fact that MSAViewer _does too much_. I want a widget that can visualize sequences to judge their alignments at a glance. To accomplish this, I _don't_ need: Fasta importing and exporting (from URLs OR Local files), Consensus Computation, Motif searching, Sorting, filtering, etc. I mean, all of these are cool features, but they should be *more available to the programmer than they are to the user*. MSAViewer is based on sort-of the opposite principle. It's surprisingly difficult to customize which of these features are made available to the user within MSAViewer. That's how it became a great app, but a terrible widget.

## OK, so what *does* this do?

It draws large numbers of enormous sequences [blisteringly fast](https://aaboyles.github.io/AlignmentViewer/benchmark/) using HTML5's [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). In case you have so many sequences that are so long it begins to get sluggish, it's also [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)-based, so you can manage it asynchronously.

## Anything else?

Not really, but down the road, I may add some complementary visual elements like sequence logos or gap weights. If you need that stuff, [please let me know](https://github.com/AABoyles/AlignmentViewer/issues/new). Until you do, they're a distant second priority.
